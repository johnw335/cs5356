Power Tools Sharing
-------------------

### Background

Every building, every neighborhood, has people passionate about owning every power tool imaginable. These are expensive and almost never used. They should be shared.

### Challenge

Part of the reason why nobody is winning in this space is because the for-profit nature of these, bound to needing to lend these ites for money. Instead, build a non-for-profit sharing economy where individuals are just sharing without asking anything in return, around power tools, an app, site, etc.

### Further Ideas

Many other things can be shared in similar ways beyond power tools!
